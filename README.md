# LoLAccountChooser
# alexxarisis@gmail.com

Simple GUI in Java Swing providing easier access to connecting to the League of Legends client.
Customizable options for already inputted accounts and data file location.
Uses points on screen to enter the given information and sign in.
Changable as well, in case of client update.

# Files
2 files:
  - .jar is the executable file
  - .bat is the cmd run command
Be sure to have the .bat in the same directory as the .jar

# Run info
On the first time opening it, choose a file location to keep
the saved accounts' info.
Also setup the points to:
1) Username
2) Password
3) The login button.
These are a must.

Lastly be sure to input the accounts you want once at the start,
to be available to use them directly.

# .bat
If you don't trust the .bat, rename it to .txt 
to see the command written inside.

# SECURITY CONCERNS
The data file where the passwords and other info are saved, is not secure.
